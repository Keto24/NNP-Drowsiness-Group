        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>
        <p><strong>By Yelnur Abdushev, Emma Gandonou, Keto</strong></p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Sleepiness while driving contributes to around 3–30% of global road accidents and 21% of fatal car collisions, and driving after 17–19 hours awake impairs psychomotor function to the level of 0.05% blood alcohol concentration <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. To address this safety issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based system that detects driver drowsiness in real time, with a particular focus on individuals wearing eyeglasses.
</p>
<p>
Our system utilizes <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/" target="_blank">MobileNetV2</a>, <a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a>, and <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>. We trained our model on two datasets — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd" target="_blank">Driver Drowsiness Dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/banudeep/nthuddd2" target="_blank">NTHU-DDD</a> — comparing the two to determine which dataset would give better results <a href="#ref4">[4]</a><a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ethical considerations include avoiding storage of user input data and ensuring balanced representation across age, gender, and racial groups. Challenges we faced include overfitting and GPU limitations. Fixes we implemented include data augmentation, early stopping, regularization, and switching from <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a> to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>.
</p>
<p>
Future work could focus on implementing a mobile app, accepting live video as model input, improving performance on low-quality cameras, and integrating the model with vehicle hardware. With further development, this specialized drowsiness detection system has the potential to save thousands of lives by providing alerts to drowsy drivers worldwide.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
This project tackles an essential issue in today’s society, and that is drowsy driving. Some studies have shown that driving with sleep deprivation is similar to driving while intoxicated. This issue doesn’t only affect drivers but also their passengers and everyone else on the road. Thus this project will focus on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers. A lot of technology has been developed targeting this issue, which provides a solid foundation for our project. However unlike existing systems, ours will focus on individuals with glasses so it will be specialized to detect drowsiness despite the user having eyewear. This web application will utilize OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data inputs will reduce bias and increase accuracy of results. Furthermore by training the neural network on many datasets, the application will be more likely to cover edge cases and provide the best outcomes. The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer.        </p>
        <p>
            While existing technologies address drowsy driving, our system is unique in its specialization for individuals wearing glasses. We integrate OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The model is trained on multiple datasets, including OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL Eye Dataset, and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data sources reduce bias and improve accuracy, ensuring coverage for edge cases.

Some ethical considerations include the use of a camera, because using camera recordings without consent would be unethical. Another consideration is if we alert law enforcement with our app, that would result in consequences for the user, and our neural network will not always be accurate. Additionally, different repercussions could happen for different demographics.        </p>

        Recent advancements in driver drowsiness detection methodologies have categorized approaches into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based methods <a href="#ref3" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Physiological methods leverage biometric signals such as EEG and ECG, behavioral methods analyze facial expressions and head movements, and vehicle-based methods evaluate driving patterns like lane deviation and steering angle changes. Challenges discussed include real-time implementation, sensor reliability, and environmental impacts on detection accuracy. This research also emphasizes integrating machine learning to enhance detection precision and adaptability.
        <p>
          Existing drowsiness detection systems have been created using CNN or ANN. A detection system proposed by Dina Salem and Mohaammed Waleed explores real-time drowsiness detection using CNNs and Transfer Learning,  achieving 90-99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets 
            <a href="#ref1" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. It's a system that integrates MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and Haar Cascade for feature extraction, and a mobile application for real-world use in driver safety. The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and real-time performance to ensure reliable drowsiness detection
        </p>
            Another ANN-based drowsiness detection system was developed using visual facial descriptors such as eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB).
            <a href="#ref2" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. The devlopers combined  EEG-based microsleep detection with facial feature analysis, achieving 72.25% sensitivity and 60.40% accuracy when using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ANN. Even though the system had moderate accuracy, it was't with out it's   limitations in practicality, as it requires  preset camera positions and restrictions on wearing sunglasses, while emphasizing the potential for real-world driver alert systems.
        <p>
            Some current products employing drowsiness detection include Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection. Motive’s product is a camera with AI that alerts drivers when they are yawning or have closed their eyes. The camera beeps and tells drivers to pull over and take a break. Bosch Mobility uses a steering angle sensor to determine the steering angle and steering angle velocity.
            <a href="#ref4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="#ref5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>. Measuring these factors allows the system to monitor the steering movements and advise drivers to take a break in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In regards to real-time system, a recent published on Journal of Physics was developed using webcam-based facial expression analysis to detect driver drowsiness. The driver’s facial expressions are captured and recorded using a webcam. 
            <a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. The system calculates the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio. The calculated values are compared to threshold values developed by the system and the difference in value leads to detection.
