        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>
        <p><strong>By Yelnur Abdushev, Emma Gandonou, Keto</strong></p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Sleepiness while driving contributes to around 3–30% of global road accidents and 21% of fatal car collisions, and driving after 17–19 hours awake impairs psychomotor function to the level of 0.05% blood alcohol concentration <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. To address this safety issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based system that detects driver drowsiness in real time, with a particular focus on individuals wearing eyeglasses.
</p>
<p>
Our system utilizes <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/" target="_blank">MobileNetV2</a>, <a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a>, and <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>. We trained our model on two datasets — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd" target="_blank">Driver Drowsiness Dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/banudeep/nthuddd2" target="_blank">NTHU-DDD</a> — comparing the two to determine which dataset would give better results <a href="#ref4">[4]</a><a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ethical considerations include avoiding storage of user input data and ensuring balanced representation across age, gender, and racial groups. Challenges we faced include overfitting and GPU limitations. Fixes we implemented include data augmentation, early stopping, regularization, and switching from <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a> to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>.
</p>
<p>
Future work could focus on implementing a mobile app, accepting live video as model input, improving performance on low-quality cameras, and integrating the model with vehicle hardware. With further development, this specialized drowsiness detection system has the potential to save thousands of lives by providing alerts to drowsy drivers worldwide.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Our project tackles an essential issue in today’s society– drowsy driving. Recent studies estimate that drowsy driving is a factor in 1.5 million car collisions every year in the U.S., causing over 8,000 fatalities and 70,000 injuries 
<a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. Driving with sleep deprivation has been shown to be equivalent to driving while intoxicated; subjects who were kept awake for 17–19 hours showed psychomotor impairment equivalent to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.05% 
<a href="#ref3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. Psychomotor impairment refers to slowed thinking and reaction time, and reduced physical movements. For comparison, the standard alcoholic drink (5 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor, or 12 ounces of beer) raises blood alcohol concentration levels by around 0.02% to 0.03%.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, drowsy drivers usually drastically underestimate their drowsiness, with 75% of drivers rating themselves as having low drowsiness being moderately to severely drowsy 
<a href="#ref7" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>. Therefore, drowsiness is dangerous not only for drivers but also for their passengers and everyone else on the road.
</p>

<p>
To address this problem, our project focuses on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers. A lot of technology has already been developed targeting this issue, which provides a solid foundation for our project. However, unlike existing systems, ours will also focus on individuals with glasses, so that the drowsiness detection system can provide accurate results for those individuals. People with glasses are often neglected when it comes to facial detection systems, and we would like to address this negligence.
</p>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>We Utilized OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. etc. Here we will talk about the steps and methods we used to implement our neural network. Topic related to first point of thesis: -Statistics related to deaths caused by drowsy driving Supporting paragraphs: -Studies of drowsy driving<p>


        <ul>
            <li>Facial feature extraction for detecting drowsiness signs.</li>
            <li>Integration of machine learning models with real-time alerts.</li>
            <li>Testing across diverse environments to ensure generalizability.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Discussion</h3>
         </p>Here we will talk about the results of our neural network. Topic related to second point of thesis: Our neural network model Supporting paragraphs: Information regarding out neural network model. </p>
        
         <h3>Ethical Sweep</h3>
        <p>
Here we will outline our updated ethical sweep based on the results of our neural network. Some ethical considerations include the use of a camera, because using camera recordings without consent would be unethical. Another consideration is if we alert law enforcement with our app, that would result in consequences for the user, and our neural network will not always be accurate. Additionally, different repercussions could happen for different demographics.        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our drowsiness detection system will be highly beneficial to the world community and will save thousands of lives on the road.</p>

         <h3>Restated Thesis</h3>
          </p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer. </p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>We want to be able to implement such technology as widely as possible, perhaps make it built into cars instead of an app.</p>

        <h3>Related Works</h3>

        <p>
        Recent advancements in driver drowsiness detection methodologies have categorized approaches into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based methods <a href="#ref3" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Physiological methods leverage biometric signals such as EEG and ECG, behavioral methods analyze facial expressions and head movements, and vehicle-based methods evaluate driving patterns like lane deviation and steering angle changes. Challenges discussed include real-time implementation, sensor reliability, and environmental impacts on detection accuracy. This research also emphasizes integrating machine learning to enhance detection precision and adaptability.
        <p>
          Existing drowsiness detection systems have been created using CNN or ANN. A detection system proposed by Dina Salem and Mohaammed Waleed explores real-time drowsiness detection using CNNs and Transfer Learning,  achieving 90-99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets 
            <a href="#ref1" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. It's a system that integrates MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and Haar Cascade for feature extraction, and a mobile application for real-world use in driver safety. The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and real-time performance to ensure reliable drowsiness detection
        </p>
            Another ANN-based drowsiness detection system was developed using visual facial descriptors such as eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB).
            <a href="#ref2" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. The devlopers combined  EEG-based microsleep detection with facial feature analysis, achieving 72.25% sensitivity and 60.40% accuracy when using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ANN. Even though the system had moderate accuracy, it was't with out it's   limitations in practicality, as it requires  preset camera positions and restrictions on wearing sunglasses, while emphasizing the potential for real-world driver alert systems.
        <p>
            Some current products employing drowsiness detection include Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection. Motive’s product is a camera with AI that alerts drivers when they are yawning or have closed their eyes. The camera beeps and tells drivers to pull over and take a break. Bosch Mobility uses a steering angle sensor to determine the steering angle and steering angle velocity.
            <a href="#ref4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="#ref5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>. Measuring these factors allows the system to monitor the steering movements and advise drivers to take a break in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In regards to real-time system, a recent published on Journal of Physics was developed using webcam-based facial expression analysis to detect driver drowsiness. The driver’s facial expressions are captured and recorded using a webcam. 
            <a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. The system calculates the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio. The calculated values are compared to threshold values developed by the system and the difference in value leads to detection.
