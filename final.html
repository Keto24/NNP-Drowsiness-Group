        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>
        <p><strong>By Yelnur Abdushev, Emma Gandonou, Keto</strong></p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Sleepiness while driving contributes to around 3–30% of global road accidents and 21% of fatal car collisions, and driving after 17–19 hours awake impairs psychomotor function to the level of 0.05% blood alcohol concentration <a href="#ref1">[1]</a><a href="#ref2">[2]</a><a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. To address this safety issue, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based system that detects driver drowsiness in real time, with a particular focus on individuals wearing eyeglasses.
</p>
<p>
Our system utilizes <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/" target="_blank">MobileNetV2</a>, <a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a>, and <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>. We trained our model on two datasets — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailnasri20/driver-drowsiness-dataset-ddd" target="_blank">Driver Drowsiness Dataset</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/banudeep/nthuddd2" target="_blank">NTHU-DDD</a> — comparing the two to determine which dataset would give better results <a href="#ref4">[4]</a><a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ethical considerations include avoiding storage of user input data and ensuring balanced representation across age, gender, and racial groups. Challenges we faced include overfitting and GPU limitations. Fixes we implemented include data augmentation, early stopping, regularization, and switching from <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank">JupyterHub</a> to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab</a>.
</p>
<p>
Future work could focus on implementing a mobile app, accepting live video as model input, improving performance on low-quality cameras, and integrating the model with vehicle hardware. With further development, this specialized drowsiness detection system has the potential to save thousands of lives by providing alerts to drowsy drivers worldwide.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Our project tackles an essential issue in today’s society– drowsy driving. Recent studies estimate that drowsy driving is a factor in 1.5 million car collisions every year in the U.S., causing over 8,000 fatalities and 70,000 injuries 
<a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. Driving with sleep deprivation has been shown to be equivalent to driving while intoxicated; subjects who were kept awake for 17–19 hours showed psychomotor impairment equivalent to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.05% 
<a href="#ref3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. Psychomotor impairment refers to slowed thinking and reaction time, and reduced physical movements. For comparison, the standard alcoholic drink (5 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor, or 12 ounces of beer) raises blood alcohol concentration levels by around 0.02% to 0.03%.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, drowsy drivers usually drastically underestimate their drowsiness, with 75% of drivers rating themselves as having low drowsiness being moderately to severely drowsy 
<a href="#ref7" class="footnote-ref">[7]</a>. Therefore, drowsiness is dangerous not only for drivers but also for their passengers and everyone else on the road.
</p>

<p>
To address this problem, our project focuses on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers. A lot of technology has already been developed targeting this issue, which provides a solid foundation for our project. However, unlike existing systems, ours will also focus on individuals with glasses, so that the drowsiness detection system can provide accurate results for those individuals. People with glasses are often neglected when it comes to facial detection systems, and we would like to address this negligence.
</p>
        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
<p>
There were numerous ethical considerations we took into account when developing our model. First of all, we ensured that our model was trained on a diverse set of data consisting of different demographic groups: people of all races, genders, and ages.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, we understand and prioritize the importance of users’ privacy, which is why, by using 
<a href="https://www.gradio.app/" target="_blank">Gradio</a>, we ensured that inputted biometric data is not used or stored permanently, and any data uploaded is automatically deleted after a session.
</p>

<p>
Although we developed our model ethically to the best of our capabilities by following the guidelines stated above, we believe our model has shortcomings, as it is very young and needs extensive time and resources to be developed in a completely ethical way. For example, using an even more diverse and extensive dataset to ensure accuracy for all types of faces. If given more time, we would train the model on additional tens of thousands of images to make it more accurate. We would also consider training our model in diverse sets of environments: day, night, cloudy, rainy, or clear weather.

Professor Saleem and Waleed of MUST University  explore real-time drowsiness detection using CNNs and transfer learning, achieving 90–99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets. Their system integrates pre-trained models like

for feature extraction, along with a mobile application for real-world use in driver safety. The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and real-time performance to ensure reliable drowsiness detection. <a href="#ref8" class="footnote-ref">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another study developed a Neural Network (NN)-based drowsiness detection system using visual facial descriptors like eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB). The system integrates EEG-based microsleep detection with facial feature analysis, achieving 72.25% sensitivity and 60.40% accuracy using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ANN. The research highlights limitations in practicality, such as requiring preset camera positions and restrictions on wearing sunglasses, while emphasizing the potential for real-world driver alert systems. <a href="#ref9" class="footnote-ref">[9]</a>

A review of recent advancements in driver drowsiness detection categorizes approaches into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based methods. Physiological methods leverage EEG, ECG, and other biometric signals, while behavioral methods focus on facial expressions, eye closure, and head movements. Vehicle-based methods analyze driving patterns, including lane deviation and steering angle changes. The review discusses challenges such as real-time implementation, sensor reliability, and environmental conditions affecting detection accuracy. The paper also highlights the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance detection precision and adaptability across different driving conditions. <a href="#ref1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
A study published in the em><Journal of Physics: Conference Series</em> developed a rdeveloped a system for detecting drowsiness in real-time. The driver’s facial expressions are captured and recorded using a webcam. The system calculates the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio. The calculated values are compared to threshold values developed by the system, and the difference in value leads to detection.

<p>
Some current products employing drowsiness detection include Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection. Motive’s product uses a camera with AI to alert drivers when they are yawning or have closed their eyes. The camera beeps and advises drivers to pull over and take a break. Bosch Mobility uses a steering angle sensor to determine both the steering angle and velocity, which allows the system to monitor the driver’s behavior and provide break recommendations.
</p>


         <h3>Ethical Sweep</h3>
        <p>
Here we will outline our updated ethical sweep based on the results of our neural network. Some ethical considerations include the use of a camera, because using camera recordings without consent would be unethical. Another consideration is if we alert law enforcement with our app, that would result in consequences for the user, and our neural network will not always be accurate. Additionally, different repercussions could happen for different demographics.        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our drowsiness detection system will be highly beneficial to the world community and will save thousands of lives on the road.</p>

         <h3>Restated Thesis</h3>
          </p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer. </p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>We want to be able to implement such technology as widely as possible, perhaps make it built into cars instead of an app.</p>
