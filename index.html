            <h2>Introduction Outline</h2>
            <p>
                Drowsy driving is a serious public safety issue, contributing to thousands of accidents annually. Many existing solutions, such as lane departure warning systems and steering behavior monitoring, fail to detect drowsiness early enough to prevent crashes. These systems primarily rely on indirect behavioral cues rather than direct physiological signs of fatigue, leading to delayed or inaccurate detections. Our project proposes a <strong>real-time drowsiness detection system</strong> that leverages <strong>computer vision and neural networks</strong> to analyze facial features and predict signs of reduced alertness. By monitoring <strong>eye movement, blinking frequency, and head positioning</strong>, the system can provide <strong>timely warnings</strong> to prevent potential accidents before they occur.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system's core components include <strong>facial feature extraction using OpenCV</strong>, <strong>neural network classification</strong>, and <strong>an alert mechanism that notifies drivers</strong> through <strong>sound alerts or SMS notifications</strong>. The use of deep learning models, such as CNNs or LSTMs, enables high accuracy in distinguishing between alert and drowsy states. Our goal is to achieve an <strong>85%+ accuracy rate</strong>, while minimizing false positives and ensuring real-time performance. The system will be tested across diverse conditions, including <strong>varied lighting, different facial structures, and multiple ethnic backgrounds</strong> to ensure fairness and generalization. Ultimately, this project aims to <strong>increase road safety</strong> by providing a <strong>more reliable and proactive drowsiness detection solution</strong> compared to traditional methods.

            <h2>Ethical Sweep</h2>
            <p><strong>General Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Should we even be doing this?</strong> Yes, as drowsiness detection improves road safety and prevents accidents.</li>
                <li><strong>What might be the accuracy of a non-ML alternative?</strong> Traditional methods, like motion sensors or steering detection, have lower accuracy and do not consider facial fatigue indicators.</li>
                <li><strong>What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes?</strong> The system should allow users to adjust sensitivity settings, disable alerts if needed, and incorporate additional validation to prevent false alarms.</li>
                <li><strong>How diverse is our team?</strong> Our team consists of members from different backgrounds, which helps reduce bias and improve inclusivity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Data Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Is our data valid for its intended use?</strong> We will use publicly available datasets and conduct additional validation.</li>
                <li><strong>What bias could be in our data?</strong> Bias may exist in skin tone detection, facial structure variation, and lighting conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>How could we minimize bias in our data and model?</strong> We will include diverse datasets with a range of ethnicities, lighting conditions, and face shapes.</li>
                <li><strong>How should we audit our code and data?</strong> Regular testing and comparison with existing models to check for fairness.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Impact Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do we expect different error rates for different sub-groups?</strong> Yes, and we will evaluate performance across different demographics.</li>
                <li><strong>What are likely misinterpretations of results?</strong> Users might rely too heavily on the system, thinking it is 100% accurate.</li>
                <li><strong>How might we impinge on individuals‚Äô privacy?</strong> The system processes facial data, so encryption and local storage are necessary to protect privacy.</li>
            </ul>
