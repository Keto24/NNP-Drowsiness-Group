        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>
        <p><strong>By Yelnur Abdushev, Emma Gandonou, Keto</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Outline and Related Works</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>This project tackles an essential issue in today’s society: drowsy driving. Some studies have shown that driving with sleep deprivation is similar to driving while intoxicated. This issue doesn’t only affect drivers but also their passengers and everyone else on the road. Thus, this project will focus on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers.</p>

        <p>Existing technology provides a solid foundation, but our project specializes in detecting drowsiness in individuals who wear glasses. The system integrates OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets used for training include OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL Eye Dataset, and the Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data inputs reduce bias and improve accuracy, ensuring that edge cases are covered for optimal performance.</p>

        <h3>Thesis:</h3>
        <p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives. We as a society can use AI to improve road safety.</p>

        <h3>Method:</h3>
        <p>We utilized OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The neural network was trained on multiple datasets to improve its robustness. The method includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facial feature extraction for detecting drowsiness signs.</li>
            <li>Integration of machine learning models with real-time alerts.</li>
            <li>Testing across diverse environments to ensure generalizability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3>
        <p>Ethical concerns include privacy issues related to camera usage and the potential consequences of alerting law enforcement. Bias in detection accuracy across demographics is also considered, and mitigation strategies will be explored.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>Our drowsiness detection system will significantly improve road safety, potentially preventing thousands of accidents.</p>

        <h3>Future Work:</h3>
        <p>We aim to expand the system for integration into built-in vehicle safety mechanisms.</p>

        <h3>Related Works:</h3>
        <p>Existing drowsiness detection systems rely on CNN or ANN models. Salem & Waleed (2024) developed a real-time CNN-based model achieving 90-99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets[^1]. Their system integrates MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and Haar Cascade for feature extraction.</p>

        <p>Inkeaw et al. (2022) proposed an ANN-based system using visual facial descriptors like EAR, MAR, face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB)[^2]. The system integrates EEG-based microsleep detection and facial feature analysis.</p>

        <p>Albadawi et al. (2022) reviewed drowsiness detection methodologies, categorizing them into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based approaches[^3]. They highlighted challenges related to real-time implementation and sensor reliability.</p>

        <p>Commercial solutions such as Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection utilize AI and sensor-based monitoring[^4][^5]. These solutions monitor steering behavior, lane deviation, and facial expressions to detect drowsiness.</p>

        <p>Chinthalachervu et al. (2022) implemented a real-time drowsiness detection system using webcam-based facial expression analysis[^6]. The model calculates EAR, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio to detect fatigue.</p>
