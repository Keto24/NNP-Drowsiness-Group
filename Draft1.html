        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>
        <p><strong>By Yelnur Abdushev, Emma Gandonou, Keto</strong></p>

        <h2>Outline and Related Works</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
This project tackles an essential issue in today’s society, and that is drowsy driving. Some studies have shown that driving with sleep deprivation is similar to driving while intoxicated. This issue doesn’t only affect drivers but also their passengers and everyone else on the road. Thus this project will focus on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers. A lot of technology has been developed targeting this issue, which provides a solid foundation for our project. However unlike existing systems, ours will focus on individuals with glasses so it will be specialized to detect drowsiness despite the user having eyewear. This web application will utilize OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data inputs will reduce bias and increase accuracy of results. Furthermore by training the neural network on many datasets, the application will be more likely to cover edge cases and provide the best outcomes. The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer.        </p>
        <p>
            While existing technologies address drowsy driving, our system is unique in its specialization for individuals wearing glasses. We integrate OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The model is trained on multiple datasets, including OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL Eye Dataset, and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data sources reduce bias and improve accuracy, ensuring coverage for edge cases.

        <h3>Introductory sentence</h3>
         <p>This project tackles an essential issue in today’s society, and that is drowsy driving.<p>
             
        <h3>Supporting paragraphs (e.g., citation or quote)</h3>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, sleepiness while driving contributes to 3% to >30% of all road traffic accidents globally. In addition, more than 20% of drivers feel a need to stop driving at least once due to sleepiness.</p>
             
        <h3>Thesis</h3>
        <p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer.

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>We Utilized OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. etc. Here we will talk about the steps and methods we used to implement our neural network. Topic related to first point of thesis: -Statistics related to deaths caused by drowsy driving Supporting paragraphs: -Studies of drowsy driving<p>


        <ul>
            <li>Facial feature extraction for detecting drowsiness signs.</li>
            <li>Integration of machine learning models with real-time alerts.</li>
            <li>Testing across diverse environments to ensure generalizability.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Discussion</h3>
         </p>Here we will talk about the results of our neural network. Topic related to second point of thesis: Our neural network model Supporting paragraphs: Information regarding out neural network model. </p>
        
         <h3>Ethical Sweep</h3>
        <p>
Here we will outline our updated ethical sweep based on the results of our neural network. Some ethical considerations include the use of a camera, because using camera recordings without consent would be unethical. Another consideration is if we alert law enforcement with our app, that would result in consequences for the user, and our neural network will not always be accurate. Additionally, different repercussions could happen for different demographics.        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our drowsiness detection system will be highly beneficial to the world community and will save thousands of lives on the road.</p>

         <h3>Restated Thesis</h3>
          </p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer. </p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>We want to be able to implement such technology as widely as possible, perhaps make it built into cars instead of an app.</p>

            Existing drowsiness detection systems rely on CNN or ANN models. Salem & Waleed (2024) developed a real-time CNN-based model achieving <strong>90-99.86% accuracy</strong> across multiple datasets 
            <a href="#ref1" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Their system integrates <strong>MobileNetV2</strong>, <strong>InceptionV3</strong>, and <strong>Haar Cascade</strong> for feature extraction.

        <p>
            Inkeaw et al. (2022) proposed an <strong>ANN-based system</strong> using visual facial descriptors like <strong>EAR, MAR, face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB)</strong> 
            <a href="#ref2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. The system integrates EEG-based microsleep detection and facial feature analysis.

        <p>
            Commercial solutions such as <strong>Motive’s Drowsiness AI</strong> and <strong>Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection</strong> utilize <strong>AI and sensor-based monitoring</strong> 
            <a href="#ref4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="#ref5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>. These solutions monitor <strong>steering behavior, lane deviation, and facial expressions</strong> to detect drowsiness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chinthalachervu et al. (2022) implemented a real-time drowsiness detection system using <strong>webcam-based facial expression analysis</strong> 
            <a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. The model calculates <strong>EAR, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio</strong> to detect fatigue.
