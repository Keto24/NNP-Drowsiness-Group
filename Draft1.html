        <h3>Title:</h3>
        <p>Driver Drowsiness Detection</p>
        
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>This project tackles an essential issue in today’s society, and that is drowsy driving. Some studies have shown that driving with sleep deprivation is similar to driving while intoxicated. This issue doesn’t only affect drivers but also their passengers and everyone else on the road. Thus this project will focus on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers.
A lot of technology has been developed targeting this issue, which provides a solid foundation for our project. However unlike existing systems, ours will focus on individuals with glasses so it will be specialized to detect drowsiness despite the user having eyewear. 
This web application will utilize OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. These diverse data inputs will reduce bias and increase accuracy of results. Furthermore by training the neural network on many datasets, the application will be more likely to cover edge cases and provide the best outcomes. The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer.

        <p>xisting drowsiness detection systems have been created using CNN or ANN. Salem & Waleed (2024) explores real-time drowsiness detection using CNNs and Transfer Learning, achieving 90-99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets. It integrates pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3, Haar Cascade for feature extraction, and a mobile application for real-world use in driver safety. The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and real-time performance to ensure reliable drowsiness detection.

Inkeaw et al. (2022) developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based drowsiness detection system using visual facial descriptors like eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB). The system integrates EEG-based microsleep detection with facial feature analysis, achieving 72.25% sensitivity and 60.40% accuracy when using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ANN. The research highlights limitations in practicality, requiring preset camera positions and restrictions on wearing sunglasses, while emphasizing the potential for real-world driver alert systems.
Albadawi et al. (2022) review recent advancements in driver drowsiness detection, categorizing approaches into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based methods. Physiological methods leverage EEG, ECG, and other biometric signals, while behavioral methods focus on facial expressions, eye closure, and head movements. Vehicle-based methods analyze driving patterns, including lane deviation and steering angle changes. The review discusses challenges such as real-time implementation, sensor reliability, and environmental conditions affecting detection accuracy. The paper also highlights the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance detection precision and adaptability across different driving conditions.
	Some current products employing drowsiness detection include Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection. Motive’s product is a camera with AI that alerts drivers when they are yawning or have closed their eyes. The camera beeps and tells drivers to pull over and take a break. Bosch Mobility uses a steering angle sensor to determine the steering angle and steering angle velocity. Measuring these factors allows the system to monitor the steering movements and advise drivers to take a break in time. 

	Chinthalachervu, R. et al (2022) developed a system for detecting drowsiness in real time. The driver’s facial expressions are captured and recorded using a webcam. The system calculates the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio. The calculated values are compared to threshold values developed by the system and the difference in value leads to detection.
