        <h1>Driver Drowsiness Detection</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Our project tackles an essential issue in today’s society, and that is drowsy driving. According to the World Health Organization, sleepiness while driving contributes to 3% to &gt;30% of all road traffic accidents globally. In addition, more than 20% of drivers feel a need to stop driving at least once due to sleepiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawson’s study has shown that driving with sleep deprivation is similar to driving while intoxicated, with subjects who were kept awake for 17–19 hours showing psychomotor impairment equivalent to blood alcohol concentration levels of 0.05% (Dawson, 1997). This is dangerous not only for drowsy drivers but also their passengers and everyone else on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this problem, our project will focus on training a neural network capable of detecting drowsiness in drivers and alerting them in time before any accidents happen. However, unlike existing systems, ours will also focus on individuals with glasses, so that the drowsiness detection system can provide the correct results for those individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are comparing datasets and it’s gonna be in an app.

        <h3>Thesis</h3>
        <p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer.

.</p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>We Utilized OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Twilio API. The datasets the neural network will be trained on is OC oC Drowsiness - Detection, MRL eye Data Set and Driver Drowsiness Dataset. etc. Here we will talk about the steps and methods we used to implement our neural network. Topic related to first point of thesis: -Statistics related to deaths caused by drowsy driving Supporting paragraphs: -Studies of drowsy driving<p>


        <ul>
            <li>Facial feature extraction for detecting drowsiness signs.</li>
            <li>Integration of machine learning models with real-time alerts.</li>
            <li>Testing across diverse environments to ensure generalizability.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Discussion Outline</h3>
        <p>We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using MobileNetV2 with transfer learning to detect driver drowsiness based on eye features extracted from real-time webcam input.</p>

<p>We used the Driver Drowsiness Dataset, which  improved the model's robustness across different eye shapes, lighting conditions, and image qualities.</p>

<p>The data was preprocessed using OpenCV to extract facial landmarks and compute the eye aspect ratio (EAR), which were then used as inputs for classification.</p>

<p>Our primary metric for model evaluation will be classification accuracy and precision, as these best reflect the model’s ability to correctly detect drowsy vs. alert states.</p>

<p>We will compare the model’s performance against baseline models and other lightweight CNNs  to understand the trade-offs in accuracy vs. inference time.</p>

<p>Compared to prior studies with access to large-scale or more curated datasets, our model is expected to perform slightly worse, though still functional enough for real-time applications.</p>

<p>In the future, we would fine-tune fewer architectures more thoroughly and experiment with different diverse  data sets  and thresholds for the eye aspect ratio to better capture edge cases like glasses or squinting.</p>

<p>One limitation we anticipate is lack of data set diversity and  reduced accuracy under poor lighting or occlusion from glasses. We aim to mitigate this through data augmentation and possibly collecting custom diverse data.</p>
        
         <h3>Ethical Sweep</h3>
        <p>
Here we will outline our updated ethical sweep based on the results of our neural network. Some ethical considerations include the use of a camera, because using camera recordings without consent would be unethical. Another consideration is if we alert law enforcement with our app, that would result in consequences for the user, and our neural network will not always be accurate. Additionally, different repercussions could happen for different demographics.        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our drowsiness detection system will be highly beneficial to the world community and will save thousands of lives on the road.</p>

         <h3>Restated Thesis</h3>
          </p>The driver drowsiness detection system will help save thousands of lives if not millions. We as a society can use AI for the benefit of our good and make our roads safer. </p>
        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>We want to be able to implement such technology as widely as possible, perhaps make it built into cars instead of an app.</p>

        Recent advancements in driver drowsiness detection methodologies have categorized approaches into physiological, behavioral, and vehicle-based methods <a href="#ref3" class="footnote-ref">[1]</a>. Physiological methods leverage biometric signals such as EEG and ECG, behavioral methods analyze facial expressions and head movements, and vehicle-based methods evaluate driving patterns like lane deviation and steering angle changes. Challenges discussed include real-time implementation, sensor reliability, and environmental impacts on detection accuracy. This research also emphasizes integrating machine learning to enhance detection precision and adaptability.
        <p>
          Existing drowsiness detection systems have been created using CNN or ANN. A detection system proposed by Dina Salem and Mohaammed Waleed explores real-time drowsiness detection using CNNs and Transfer Learning,  achieving 90-99.86% accuracy across multiple datasets 
            <a href="#ref1" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a>. It's a system that integrates MobileNetV2, InceptionV3 and Haar Cascade for feature extraction, and a mobile application for real-world use in driver safety. The study highlights the importance of dataset diversity, bias mitigation, and real-time performance to ensure reliable drowsiness detection
        </p>
            Another ANN-based drowsiness detection system was developed using visual facial descriptors such as eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), face length (FL), and face width balance (FWB).
            <a href="#ref2" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>. The devlopers combined  EEG-based microsleep detection with facial feature analysis, achieving 72.25% sensitivity and 60.40% accuracy when using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with ANN. Even though the system had moderate accuracy, it was't with out it's   limitations in practicality, as it requires  preset camera positions and restrictions on wearing sunglasses, while emphasizing the potential for real-world driver alert systems.
        <p>
            Some current products employing drowsiness detection include Motive’s Drowsiness AI and Bosch’s Driver Drowsiness Detection. Motive’s product is a camera with AI that alerts drivers when they are yawning or have closed their eyes. The camera beeps and tells drivers to pull over and take a break. Bosch Mobility uses a steering angle sensor to determine the steering angle and steering angle velocity.
            <a href="#ref4" class="footnote-ref">[4]</a><a href="#ref5" class="footnote-ref">[5]</a>. Measuring these factors allows the system to monitor the steering movements and advise drivers to take a break in time.
        </p>

        <p>
          In regards to real-time system, a recent published on Journal of Physics was developed using webcam-based facial expression analysis to detect driver drowsiness. The driver’s facial expressions are captured and recorded using a webcam. 
            <a href="#ref6" class="footnote-ref">[6]</a>. The system calculates the eye aspect ratio, mouth opening ratio, and nose length ratio. The calculated values are compared to threshold values developed by the system and the difference in value leads to detection.
